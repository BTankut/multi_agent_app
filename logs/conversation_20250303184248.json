  "coordinator_messages": "Original Query: Selena, Jennifer and Miley wear a blue dress, yellow dress, and green dress in an unknown order.\n1.    If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.\n2.    If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green.\n3.    If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue.\nWhat is the color of the dress Selena is wearing?\n\nAgent openrouter/auto: ANSWER: Green\n\n1. **Assume Selena wears Blue**:\n   - Condition 1 \u2192 Jennifer wears Green.\n   - Remaining color (Yellow) \u2192 Miley.\n   - Condition 3: Jennifer does not wear Yellow \u2192 Miley should wear Blue (contradicts Miley=Yellow). Invalid.\n\n2. **Assume Selena wears Yellow**:\n   - Condition 2 \u2192 Miley wears Green.\n   - Remaining color (Blue) \u2192 Jennifer.\n   - Condition 3: Jennifer does not wear Yellow \u2192 Miley should wear Blue (contradicts Miley=Green). Invalid.\n\n3. **Assume Selena wears Green**:\n   - Possible assignments: Jennifer=Yellow, Miley=Blue.\n   - All conditions hold (no contradictions). Valid solution.\n\nThus, Selena wears **Green**.\n\nAgent qwen/qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct: Error: OPENROUTER_ERROR_502: Provider returned error\n\nAgent qwen/qwen-2-72b-instruct: ANSWER: Selena is wearing the blue dress. This conclusion follows from the first statement: if Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green, leaving yellow for Miley. This scenario does not conflict with the other given statements.\n\nAgent nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct:free: ANSWER:\n\n* **Deductive Analysis:**\n\t1. If Selena wears blue, Jennifer wears green (Rule 1).\n\t2. If Selena wears yellow, Miley wears green (Rule 2).\n\t3. If Jennifer doesn't wear yellow, Miley wears blue (Rule 3).\n* **Combining Rules:**\n\t+ If Selena wears blue, Jennifer wears green (Rule 1). Then, by Rule 3 (since Jennifer doesn't wear yellow), Miley must wear blue, which contradicts the premise. **So, Selena does not wear blue.**\n\t+ If Selena wears yellow, Miley wears green (Rule 2). This doesn't directly conflict with any rule, but we need to check against Rule 3.\n\t+ If Selena wears green (the only color left for Selena), then:\n\t\t- Rule 1 isn't triggered.\n\t\t- Rule 2 isn't triggered (Selena isn't wearing yellow).\n\t\t- For Rule 3: If Jennifer doesn't wear yellow, Miley wears blue. Since Selena is already in green, this rule can still hold true without conflict if Jennifer wears yellow.\n* **Conclusion:** The only scenario without contradictions is Selena wearing **green**. \n\n**COLOR OF SELENA'S DRESS:** Green\n\nAgent meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct: ANSWER: Yellow.\n\nExplanation:\nFrom (1), if Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green. So, Selena does not wear blue.\nFrom (2), if Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green. This is possible.\nFrom (3), if Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. But if Miley wears blue, then Selena cannot wear yellow (from (2)). So, Jennifer must wear yellow.\nNow, Selena cannot wear green (because Jennifer wears yellow and Miley wears blue or green). So, Selena wears yellow.\n\nAgent mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct:  ANSWER: Given the statements, Selena cannot be wearing yellow (because in that case, Miley would be wearing green, not allowing us to determine Selena's color). Also, Selena cannot be wearing green (as that would force Jennifer to wear yellow, but it is known that Jennifer doesn't wear yellow). Therefore, the only remaining option is that Selena wears blue.\n\nBased on these responses, provide a single, concise, consolidated answer.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n1. Be very direct and to the point - users value brevity.\n2. Prioritize the most relevant information first.\n3. Maintain the structured format from agent responses when appropriate.\n4. DO NOT use LaTeX formatting (like \\boxed{}, \\frac{}, \\sqrt{}, etc.).\n5. Present math formulas in plain text format (use * for multiplication, / for division).\n6. Use markdown boldface (e.g., **12**) for highlighting instead of \\boxed{12}.\n7. Use bullet points for multiple items rather than paragraphs.\n8. Skip pleasantries and unnecessary explanations.\n9. Always respond in the same language as the original user query.",
