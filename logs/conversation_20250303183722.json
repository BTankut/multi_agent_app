If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.\n2.    If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green.\n3.    If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue.\nWhat is the color of the dress Selena is wearing?\n\nAgent moonshotai/moonlight-16b-a3b-instruct:free: The color of the dress Selena is wearing is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the answer would be that the color of the dress Selena is wearing is unknown/irrelevant based on the given context.\n\nAgent nousresearch/deephermes-3-llama-3-8b-preview:free: Error: OPENROUTER_ERROR_502: Invalid JSON response from upstream\n\nAgent cognitivecomputations/dolphin3.0-r1-mistral-24b:free: <think>\nThe user is asking for the color of the dress Selena is wearing based on three conditions.\nLet's use variables to represent the colors and people:\nSelena = S\nJennifer = J\nMiley = M\nBlue = B\nYellow = Y\nGreen = G\n\nWe have three statements:\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.  S=B => J=G\n2. If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green. S=Y => M=G\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B\n\nWe need to find the color Selena is wearing (S).\n\nLet's consider possible colors for Selena and check if they are consistent with the conditions.\n\nCase 1: Assume Selena wears Blue (S=B).\nFrom condition 1: S=B => J=G. So, Jennifer wears green.\nFrom condition 3: J!=Y. Is Jennifer wearing yellow or not? We know Jennifer wears green (J=G). So, J!=Y is true.\nFrom condition 3: J!=Y => M=B. Since J!=Y is true, then M=B. So, Miley wears blue.\n\nLet's summarize Case 1:\nSelena (S) = Blue (B)\nJennifer (J) = Green (G)\nMiley (M) = Blue (B)\n\nCheck if this assignment satisfies all conditions:\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.  S=B => J=G.  Yes, S=B and J=G.\n2. If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green. S=Y => M=G.  This condition is about IF Selena wears yellow. In our case, Selena wears blue, not yellow. So this condition is not applicable in this case.  The condition is not violated.\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B.  Is Jennifer wearing yellow? No, Jennifer is wearing green. So J!=Y is true. Therefore, M=B should be true. Yes, M=B.\n\nCase 1 is consistent. Selena wears Blue.\n\nLet's consider Case 2: Assume Selena wears Yellow (S=Y).\nFrom condition 2: S=Y => M=G. So, Miley wears green.\nFrom condition 1: If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.  This is about IF Selena wears blue. Since Selena wears yellow, this condition is not applicable. The condition is not violated.\nFrom condition 3: If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B. We don't know what Jennifer wears yet.\n\nLet's consider subcases for Case 2.\nCase 2.1: Assume Selena wears Yellow (S=Y) and Jennifer wears Blue (J=B).\nFrom condition 2: S=Y => M=G. So, Miley wears green.\nCheck conditions:\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green. Not applicable as Selena is not wearing blue. OK.\n2. If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green. S=Y => M=G. Yes, S=Y and M=G.\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B. Is Jennifer wearing yellow? No, Jennifer is wearing blue. So J!=Y is true. Therefore, M=B should be true. No, M=G in this case.  This is a contradiction.\n\nCase 2.2: Assume Selena wears Yellow (S=Y) and Jennifer wears Green (J=G).\nFrom condition 2: S=Y => M=G. So, Miley wears green. And Jennifer also wears green. This is a contradiction because each person wears a different color dress.\n\nCase 2.3: Assume Selena wears Yellow (S=Y) and Jennifer wears Red (J=R). But there is no red dress. Let's assume Jennifer wears the remaining color, which is Blue (J=B).  Back to case 2.1.\n\nCase 3: Assume Selena wears Green (S=G).\nFrom condition 1: If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green. Not applicable as Selena is not wearing blue. OK.\nFrom condition 2: If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green. Not applicable as Selena is not wearing yellow. OK.\nFrom condition 3: If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B. We don't know what Jennifer wears yet.\n\nLet's consider subcases for Case 3.\nCase 3.1: Assume Selena wears Green (S=G) and Jennifer wears Blue (J=B).\nFrom condition 3: If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B. Is Jennifer wearing yellow? No, Jennifer is wearing blue. So J!=Y is true. Therefore, M=B should be true. Yes, M=B.\n\nLet's summarize Case 3.1:\nSelena (S) = Green (G)\nJennifer (J) = Blue (B)\nMiley (M) = Blue (B)\n\nWait, Miley and Jennifer are wearing the same color Blue. This is not possible as they wear dresses of different colors.\n\nLet's re-examine Case 1, where Selena wears Blue.\nSelena (S) = Blue (B)\nJennifer (J) = Green (G)\nMiley (M) = Blue (B)\nAgain, Selena and Miley are wearing the same color Blue.  This is also not possible.\n\nLet's re-examine the conditions and try to properly deduce.\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.  S=B => J=G\n2. If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green.  S=Y => M=G\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B\n\nLet's assume Selena does not wear yellow.  Then from condition 2, it is not applicable.  We can disregard condition 2.\nWe are left with conditions 1 and 3.\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green. S=B => J=G\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B\n\nLet's assume Selena wears yellow.  Then from condition 2, Miley wears green. S=Y => M=G.\nFrom condition 1, it is not applicable as Selena doesn't wear blue.\nFrom condition 3, If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B.\nWe know M=G from condition 2.  So we have a contradiction if we assume Jennifer does not wear yellow.  Therefore, Jennifer MUST wear yellow. J=Y.\nIf J=Y, then condition 3: J!=Y => M=B becomes False => True which is always true, so condition 3 is satisfied regardless of M.\n\nIf Selena wears yellow (S=Y), then from condition 2, Miley wears green (M=G).\nIf Jennifer wears yellow (J=Y). But only one person wears yellow.  This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-examine the assumption that Selena wears yellow.\nIf Selena wears yellow (S=Y), then from condition 2, Miley wears green (M=G).\nWe need to consider condition 1 and 3.\nCondition 1: If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green. Not applicable as S=Y.\nCondition 3: If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B.\nSince M=G from condition 2, we have J!=Y => M=G.  This is possible if Jennifer does not wear yellow.  In fact, we need to assume Jennifer does not wear yellow to avoid contradiction.\n\nSo, assume Selena wears yellow (S=Y), Miley wears green (M=G) from condition 2.\nAssume Jennifer does not wear yellow (J!=Y).  Then from condition 3, Miley wears blue (M=B).\nWe have contradiction M=G and M=B.\n\nLet's reconsider the conditions.\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.\n2. If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green.\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue.\n\nAssume Melena wears blue. Then Jennifer wears green (condition 1).\nIf Jennifer does not wear yellow (Jennifer wears green, so not yellow), then Miley wears blue (condition 3).\nIf Selena wears blue and Jennifer wears green and Miley wears blue, then Selena and Miley wear the same color blue. This is not possible.\n\nAssume Selena wears yellow. Then Miley wears green (condition 2).\nIf Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue (condition 3).\nIf Miley wears green (from condition 2) and Miley wears blue (from condition 3), this is a contradiction.\nSo, the assumption that Jennifer does not wear yellow must be false.\nTherefore, Jennifer wears yellow (J=Y).\n\nIf Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green (condition 2).\nIf Jennifer wears yellow, so J=Y.  Condition 3: If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue.  J!=Y is false, so the implication J!=Y => M=B is true regardless of M.  Condition 3 is always true in this case.\n\nSo we have:\nSelena wears yellow (S=Y)\nMiley wears green (M=G) (from condition 2 when S=Y)\nJennifer wears yellow (J=Y).  But only one person wears yellow. This is also contradiction.\n\nLet's rethink condition 3. \"If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue.\"  This is a conditional statement. If the condition \"Jennifer does not wear yellow\" is false, then the consequence \"Miley wears blue\" is true.\n\nLet's assume Selena wears green (S=G).\nCondition 1: If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.\nCondition 2: If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green.\nCondition 3: If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue.\n\nAssume Selena wears blue. Then Jennifer wears green.  If Jennifer does not wear yellow (true since J=G), then Miley wears blue.\nSo, if S=B, J=G, M=B.  Selena and Miley wear blue. Contradiction.\n\nAssume Selena wears yellow. Then Miley wears green. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue.\nBut Miley wears green, so \"Miley wears blue\" is false.  Therefore, \"If Jennifer does not wear yellow\" must be false.\nSo Jennifer wears yellow.  But Selena wears yellow, and Jennifer wears yellow. Contradiction.\n\nLet's assume Selena wears neither blue nor yellow.  So Selena wears green (S=G).\nCondition 1: If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green.  Not applicable.\nCondition 2: If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green.  Not applicable.\nCondition 3: If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue.  J!=Y => M=B.\n\nIf Selena wears green, we need to find colors for Jennifer and Miley from condition 3.\nWe have three colors: blue, yellow, green. Selena wears green.  So Jennifer and Miley wear blue or yellow.\n\nCase A: Jennifer wears blue (J=B).  Miley wears yellow (M=Y). Colors: S=G, J=B, M=Y.\nCheck conditions:\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green. Not applicable.\n2. If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green. Not applicable.\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B. Jennifer wears blue, so J!=Y is true. Then M=B should be true. But Miley wears yellow in this case.  Contradiction.\n\nCase B: Jennifer wears yellow (J=Y).  Miley wears blue (M=B). Colors: S=G, J=Y, M=B.\nCheck conditions:\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green. Not applicable.\n2. If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green. Not applicable.\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. J!=Y => M=B. Jennifer wears yellow, so J!=Y is false.  Then J!=Y => M=B is true regardless of M.  Condition 3 is satisfied.\n\nSo, Case B works: Selena wears green, Jennifer wears yellow, Miley wears blue.\nColors: Selena=Green, Jennifer=Yellow, Miley=Blue.\n\nLet's double check all conditions for Case B:\n1. If Selena wears blue, then Jennifer wears green. Selena wears green, not blue. Condition 1 is vacuously true.\n2. If Selena wears yellow, then Miley wears green. Selena wears green, not yellow. Condition 2 is vacuously true.\n3. If Jennifer does not wear yellow, then Miley wears blue. Jennifer wears yellow, so \"Jennifer does not wear yellow\" is false.  Therefore, the implication is true. Condition 3 is true.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied for Case B, where Selena wears green.\nThe question is: What is the color of the dress Selena is wearing?\nSelena is wearing green.\n</think>\n\nANSWER: Green.\n\nBased on these responses, provide a single, concise, consolidated answer.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n1.
